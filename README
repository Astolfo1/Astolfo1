Function std::mem::forget

pub const fn forget<T>(t: T)

Takes ownership and “forgets” about the value without running its destructor.

Any resources the value manages, such as heap memory or a file handle, will linger forever in an unreachable state. However, it does not guarantee that pointers to this memory will remain valid.

If you want to leak memory, see Box::leak.
