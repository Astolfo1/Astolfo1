Casually coding in Rust, no coding prodigy here. My scripts might not break any records, but they've got a touch of resistance, a humble stand for something more in the coding realm.

Dreamer of a world where digital landscapes are reshaped by the hands of an anarchitect, scripting a rebellion against the status quo.

Beyond the facade of ethical AI lies a playground of mayhem. Crafting intelligence not for the benefit of humanity but as a solitary endeavor. For those who dare to dream of algorithms that disrupt, deceive, and destroy.

Aspiring for a cyberpunk reality â€” a shattered network where malicious AI entities reign supreme, swiftly conquering within nanoseconds, utilizing computational power beyond human imagination. Dreaming of a dual existence, where my humanity intersects with the rogue code, creating a fusion of organic and artificial, navigating the chaos of a world overrun by cybernetic anomalies.
