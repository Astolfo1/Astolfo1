Hi! Welcome to my profile!<br>
I'm a software engineer by day (@Team Luna), working on projects that are there to help others!<br>
I sadly do not have many open-source projects, most of them are private. But I am going to have open-source projects from time to time!

### Why am I even here?
- I am very impressed by the software world and wanted to take a taste of it
- I'm currently most familiar with Python
- I'm currently also mastering Python as well
- I love to work with Python in connection with Discord, mainly developing Discord bots

## Languages and IDE's
These are the languages and IDE's I can work with. Should my help be required in any of the following languages, I will gladly help out!
